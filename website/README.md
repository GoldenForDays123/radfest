# FAQ
What is RadFest?	RadFest is a diy festival put together by Rachel Feldman and Adam Goldstein. We have been inspired by our friends who have put on diy music festivals and silly weekends and wanted to take those ideas for a whirl. We describe RadFest as the intersection between living on a commune for three days, summer camp, and burning man. 
	
Who should come?	If you read the description above and say it sounds like a "nightmare", like my sister did, this isn't for you. If you are inspired by the blend of coliving with your friends and their friends, spending time in nature, using all of our creativity to develop a weekend full of giddiness, fun, play, relaxation, and party, we would love for you to be there. If you have 1-2 friends who you think would like to join, please feel free to invite them to join us. We do have a cap of 50 people at the moment, so please submit the form and venmo your deposit to hold your spot soon. 
	
What will we eat? 	We will buy enough food ahead of time for us to cook all of our meals together at the venue. We plan to prepare vegan friendly meals for the weekend. This looks like a taco bar one night, a big pasta dish another night, DIY sandwiches for lunch, etc. Nothing fancy but we hope it's delicious! Vegan friendly to us means that there will always be an entree that's vegan and something non vegan might optionally be added to it. For example, on pasta night, the pasta will be vegan but there will be optional cheese on the side.  In the spirit of coliving, we will all be signing up for jobs ahead of time so chances are you will help to cook at least one meal and clean after at least one meal as well. Thanks for chipping in to help everything run smoothly! We can't do this without you. 
	
What will we do? 	In the style of summer camp or a music festival, we plan to "program" the whole weekend. You will get a brochure upon arrival with the details. We ask you to consider leading an activity over the course of the weekend as requested on the signup form. Based on nothing at all, a sample itinerary for one day might look like 7:30 Yoga led by Amy, 8:30 family breakfast, 10:00 forest bathing, 12:00 family lunch, 1:00 juggling with Ben, 2:00 improv with Chris, 3:00 group tubing adventure, 5:00 frisbee, 6:00 friendship bracelets and collaging by the river with Sophia, 7:00 family dinner, 8:00 ecstatic dancing, 9:00 show and tell,10:00-1:00 DJ set. Everything is optional but also encouraged. 
	
What should I bring?	You should bring everything you might need for a three night camping trip. Don't forget your underwear, socks, clothes, bathing suit, sunscreen, bugspray, toiletries, medicines, headlamp, flashlight, hammock, etc. You should also bring props to play with (think hula hoop, etc) any supplies needed for the activity you've signed up to host (ie string if you're teaching bracelet making). If you'd like to participate in shakedown street, bring art/clothes to trade/sell. 
	
What should I wear?	We will have one formal dinner so bring a snaaazzyy outfit for that. Otherwise wear comfy summer clothes and bring at least one bathing suit! If you have clothes you've been saving for a silly occasion, now's your time to pull those out. 
	
Where will I sleep? Can I choose who I sleep with? 	Yes! We'll prearrange the rooming situations. If there are friends you'd like to be bunked with, please list them on the form. However, we hope in the spirit of RadFest you bring an open mind and heart and prepare to make lots of new friends! There is a mix of lodging options on the property, but everyone will have a bed! You'll stay in a yurt, cottage, bunkhouse, or airstream. If you have a strong request, please include that in the form. 
	
How should I prepare best for RadFest? 	First, put the weekend of Thursday, August 27th-Sunday, August 30th on your calendar. Second, request PTO for Friday, August 28th. Third, fill out the form on our website to lock in your spot. Fourth, wait a while. Yeah, we know, we did this WAY ahead of time, but our beautiful venue already was almost booked up for next summer! Once the timing gets closer, we'll have a few prep meetings for those coming from DC to get you excited. You know those events you're invited to and you get really excited to prepare for and then once they get closer you sorta half-ass them? For me, this often how Halloween goes. Well, we don't want that to happen with RadFest. So we'll make sure this is top of mind for the entire month leading up to it to make sure you prep your outfits, the activity you're leading, the merch/goods you may want to trade and sell. Finally, be ready to become friends with 50 other people and have an open mind!
	
When do I actually need to be there? When do we leave?	We encourage you to arrive sometime at night on Thursday, August 27th. If you're coming from DC, please try to leave by 6:00 and then you will arrive around 8:30pm. We won't be serving dinner Thursday night so please eat before you come. We will have our first activity of the weekend at 11:00pm, sort of an initiation ceremony, so at least try to be there before then! If you have to arrive Friday morning, the earlier the better in our opinion! Check out is on Sunday at 12pm so we all need to be up at 9:00am to have some breakfast and clean before departing. There is a very detailed check out task list we'll work on together. If you have to leave earlier on Sunday, please let us know. 
	
What if I don't have a car? What if I'm coming from outside DC?	In our form we collect information about who has a car and who needs a ride. We'll figure out a way to assign riders to drivers don't worry!  If you're coming from outside DC, please communicate with Rachel and Adam to make sure we get you there. You should probably plan to fly to DCA sometime on Thursday and get a ride with DC friends that evening. 
	
Where is this? 	We've rented a beautiful retreat center called Three Otters Eco Retreat in West Virginia, about 2.5 hour drive from DC. There is spotty cell service and no wifi at Three Otters. 
	
How much does this cost? 	If we have exactly 50 people in attendance, it will cost $141/per person for the lodging/venue. We will create a food price on top of that, but we're aiming for that to be as cheap as possible. We also plan to offer an optional alcohol package so that we can make sure those who don't drink don't have this included in their food price. 
	
Do you accept ideas or do you have this all planned out?	Yes please! This is a communal festival, please submit ideas to radfest.ramblingrascals@gmail.com. Think activity ideas, meal ideas, snack ideas, etc. If you have ANY questions about RadFest, please send us an email!
	
I love this so much how can I be more helpful?	We would like to have a host committee! Please email us if you'd like to be a part of it. Ahead of RadFest the host committee will meet more often to make sure everything is planned. The host committee also might have more responsibility- IE printing the brochures, helping to grocery shop, etc. We take ideas suggested by our host committee VERY seriously.
	
Will there be merch?	YES
	
Will this be annual?	MAYBE
	
How do I pay?	We will ask you to venmo us a $20 deposit now to lock in your spot. This is mostly so you can't back out without telling us, giving us an opportunity to convince you not to :) We'll ask you to venmo us the rest about a month before the event. 
	
I have another question I think others might have!	Please email us your question and we'll add it to this page! radfest.ramblingrascals@gmail.com
